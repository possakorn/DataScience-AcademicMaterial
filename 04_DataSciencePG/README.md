### Assignment: Data Implementation Flow

**Description:** 
These assignments introduce the fundamental concepts of modern data science, equipping tools to handle real, messy data and apply appropriate methods safely. The assignments cover the entire data analysis process, including data acquisition, **cleaning**, **preprocessing**, and **modeling**. Using various regression models (lasso, ridge, splines), classification models (logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, SVMs, random forests), and unsupervised learning methods (PCA, k-means, hierarchical clustering) in R programming. Finally, models will be tuned to achieve optimized outcomes.
