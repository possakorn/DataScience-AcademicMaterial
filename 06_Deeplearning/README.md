### Report 1: Diabetes Prediction via Perceptron

**Description:** This assignment investigates the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), specifically perceptron algorithms, to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The study includes optimizing learning rates, selecting appropriate optimization algorithms, and adjusting model complexity to enhance predictive accuracy and mitigate overfitting. <br>Our results indicate that a multi-layer perceptron with one hidden layer and 32 nodes is optimal, achieving 74.5% accuracy without overfitting. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ANN in identifying patterns in medical data, contributing to improved diabetes prediction and potential future applications.

### Report 2: Image Classification via CNN

**Description:** This study investigates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, focusing on the capabilities and effectiveness of different network architectures. We evaluated several models, including AlexNet, VGG19, and various configurations of ResNet, on datasets such as Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. <br>Our analysis highlights the superior performance of deep residual networks, particularly ResNet18, which achieved accuracy rates of 93.7%, 89.6%, and 65.2% on Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, respectively. <br>These findings demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of residual learning in handling complex image data, underscoring the critical role of deep learning techniques in advancing image classification tasks.

### Report 3: Stock Price Market Prediction using RNN

**Description:** This project investigates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for predicting stock prices, focusing on the comparison of various RNN architectures including LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and BiGRU. Using real historical data from the S&P 500 index, we designed and implemented experiments to assess the predictive performance of these models. <br>Our methodology involved normalizing and transforming the data to capture its non-linear and dynamic characteristics, and conducting a thorough analysis of model performance. <br>The experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of the BiGRU model, which effectively captures both past and future dependencies within the data, thereby improving accuracy in financial forecasting. The findings highlight the potential of advanced RNN architectures in the field of stock price prediction and provide insights into their application in real-world financial markets.
