## Course 7: Natural Language Processing (NLP)


This course explores advanced machine learning techniques that can be effectively applied to natural language processing (NLP). NLP is essential for enabling effective communication between humans and machines. Uilize Deep Learning models for text processing, and distinguish NLP from other application domains extend the application to the current technologies. These concepts will be reinforced through examples and practical projects using deep learning tools applied to NLP.

### Project 1: Text classification and sentiment analysis

**Description:** This project focuses on implementing a natural language model to analyze sentiment in real hotel reviews, providing insights into text processing techniques such as text normalization, named entity extraction, and syntactic parsing. By understanding the context within the comments, this model aids in managing customer relationships effectively. The results of this sentiment analysis can enhance business decisions and provide stakeholders with logical information and actionable insights.

### Project 2: Information Retrieval-based Question Answering (IR QA) system 

**Description:** The project focuses on developing a robust Information Retrieval-based Question Answering (IR QA) system to efficiently navigate and extract precise knowledge from vast information landscapes. Our system employs innovative strategies, including selective preprocessing with lowercase normalization, Fastcoref for coreference resolution, and TextBlob for sentence splitting. The Semantic DistilBERT model excels in similarity matching, resulting in an MRR of 1.00 and a MAP of 0.96, with an overall F1-score of 0.71, indicating a high alignment with user queries. Challenges include managing complex queries and capturing longer sentences, which are areas for future enhancement. This project underscores the transformative impact of machine learning in information retrieval and sets the stage for further advancements in AI-driven question answering systems.
