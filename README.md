## Course 1: Data Taming

The course mainly focused on application of statistical methods to build solution, addressing to real-world problems. The academic projects and assignments conducted via **R programming** for data science, including exploratory data analysis, data transformation, as well as prediction and reporting.
**Coding:** R programming.<br>
**Visualization:** mainly reporting on **RMarkdown** and visualizing via **ggplot**

### Assignment 1: Cricket Statistical Exploration

**Description:** This assignment involves the analysis of cricket statistics from the 2019 Ashes series between Australia and England. The tasks include data cleaning, univariate and bivariate analysis, and visualization using R Markdown. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in data manipulation and statistical analysis in R.

### Assignment 2: Boston Sun-Times Circulation Prediction

**Description:** This assignment involves analyzing data from the Boston Sun-Times to help Masthead Media decide whether to continue investing in investigative journalism or to shift towards a more populist, tabloid style. The analysis uses data on newspaper circulation and Pulitzer Prizes to predict circulation changes and make strategic recommendations.

### Assignment 3: Melbourne Evaporation Prediction

**Description:** This assignment successfully developed a prediction model to enhance the Melbourne Water Corporation's management of the Cardinia Reservoir by accurately forecasting daily evaporation. The model identified Month, Minimum temperature, Relative humidity, and their interactions as significant predictors. It revealed that evaporation rates are highest in summer and lowest in winter. By utilizing this model, MWC can better manage water supply, ensuring consistent and efficient resource allocation, particularly during periods of high evaporation.

### Assignment 4: Engagement Prediction on personal and demographic factors

**Description:** This assignment successfully developed a prediction model to assess the likelihood of individuals engaging in extramarital affairs based on personal and demographic factors. Using data from a 1969 survey of Psychology Today readers, the model identified key predictors, including age, years married, religiousness, education level, occupation, and marital satisfaction. The analysis revealed significant relationships between these predictors and the likelihood of an affair. The model was evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, demonstrating its reliability in predicting extramarital affairs. This model can help better understand the factors influencing such behaviors and inform targeted advice or interventions.
